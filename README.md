# Number Theory Library (NTLib)

A small C++ library containing common number theory implementations.
The library should contain modular implementations that can easily be combined to solve mathematical problems.
Most code was used and developed to solve [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems.

# Requirements
* Uses plenty of C++20 features, such as the three way comparison operator and modules. Therefore an up to date compiler such as Clang-10 is required.
* Cmake and CTest.
