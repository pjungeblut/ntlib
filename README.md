# Number Theory Library (NTLib)

A small C++ library containing common number theory implementations.
The library should contain modular implementations that can easily be combined to solve mathematical problems.
Most code was used to solve [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems, which are currently also the main tests.
