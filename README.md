# Number Theory Library (NTLib)

A small C++ library containing common number theory implementations.
The library should contain modular implementations that can easily be combined to solve mathematical problems.
Most code was used and developed to solve [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems.

# Requirements
* G++10 or higher to allow use of three way comparison operator.
